// qt/omegasshvault.h
//
// C++ front end for the vault C surface, the way omegasshsession.h is one for
// the session surface. Same house rules: QtCore types only, no QtWidgets, one
// owner for every allocation, and nothing that hands a secret back.
//
// THE SHAPE IS INHERITED, NOT INVENTED. include/omegassh/vault.h says it in
// one line -- metadata comes out, secrets only go in -- and this file's job is
// to make that hard to get wrong from C++ rather than merely documented. Hence
// two distinct record types instead of one:
//
//   CredentialMeta   what a read returns. No material fields exist on it, so
//                    there is no member for a UI to accidentally populate and
//                    no member for a redacted round trip to blank out.
//   CredentialInput  what a write takes when the user supplied material.
//
// and two write calls that differ by which type they accept. store() replaces
// a record wholesale, which is why it takes the type that carries material;
// updateMetadata() cannot lose a password because the type it takes has none
// to omit. The sharp corner the C header warns about is a compile error here.
//
// ERRORS. Every call returns VaultError rather than a bool, because the whole
// reason the C surface has codes is that a caller has to branch on why: a
// wrong password re-prompts, an unreachable keyring offers manual credentials
// instead, and neither is served by a message box with one string in it. The
// detail text is captured into lastError() on every non-OK return, so the C
// rule "read it only after a failure" is enforced here once instead of at
// every call site.
//
// THREADING. Safe from any thread; the Go side is mutex-guarded. Three calls
// run Argon2id and cost real time -- create(), unlock() and changeMaster(),
// tens of milliseconds on a many-core box and well over a hundred on one core.
// That is a visible stutter, not a hang, so this wrapper stays synchronous and
// the dialog puts up a busy cursor rather than the application growing a
// worker thread and a signal for something that finishes before a user can
// notice it is gone. If it ever needs to be asynchronous, it needs to be
// asynchronous everywhere, and that is a different change.
//
// LIFETIME. A Vault owns its handle and closes it in the destructor, which
// locks it first. Non-copyable, because two owners of one handle means one of
// them closes it out from under the other. Config::vaultHandle wants handle(),
// and it must not outlive this object -- in practice the shell owns one Vault
// for the life of the process.
