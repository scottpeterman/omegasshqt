// UpdateMetadata: the read-modify-write that makes a credential editable
// without a secret in hand.
//
// Update replaces a record wholesale, which is correct and is also the reason
// a UI cannot use it for an ordinary edit. The manager reads redacted metadata
// -- no password, no key path, no passphrase, by design -- so sending that
// record back with a corrected description would store a record whose secret
// fields are empty. The password is gone, nothing failed, and the next dial is
// the first anyone hears about it.
//
// Rename and SetDisabled already avoid that by doing the read-modify-write on
// this side, where the secret is reachable. This is the same move generalised
// to the rest of the non-secret fields, so the UI needs exactly two write
// paths and the sharp one is the one that says so:
//
//	UpdateMetadata -- the user edited fields; material is untouched.
//	Update/Add     -- the user supplied material; the record is replaced.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT touch: AuthType, Password, KeyPath,
// KeyPassphrase, CreatedAt, LastUsed, ID. AuthType is in that list because a
// credential's method and its material move together -- switching a record
// from password to publickey without supplying a key is a record that cannot
// authenticate, and the caller that has a key is the caller that should be
// using Update.

// UpdateMetadata merges the non-secret fields of c onto the stored credential
// with the same ID, leaving its material, timestamps and auth method as they
// were. Name uniqueness is enforced the same way Update enforces it.
//
// IsDefault is honoured in one direction only: true promotes this credential
// and clears any other, false leaves the current default alone. A metadata
// form that round-trips a redacted record would otherwise clear the default
// flag every time someone edited a different credential -- the record it is
// saving says is_default:false because it is not the default, which is not the
// same statement as "there should be no default".
