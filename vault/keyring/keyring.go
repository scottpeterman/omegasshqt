// vault/keyring/keyring.go
//
// OS-backed storage for the vault master password: Windows Credential
// Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service. This is the "no plaintext
// path" half of the credential-storage requirement — the vault file has
// always been encrypted, but until now the only way to open it without a
// human was an environment variable, which is a plaintext path wearing a
// different hat.
//
// What is stored is the master password itself, not a wrapping key. The
// earlier design sketch had the keyring hold a 32-byte wrapping key with the
// master sealed under it in a sidecar file; that buys nothing. Both the
// keyring entry and the sidecar live on the same machine under the same user,
// so anything that can read one can read the other, and the indirection only
// adds a file that can go missing. The vault's on-disk format is untouched
// either way, which was the actual requirement: Argon2id still derives the
// AES key from the master, and the keyring only answers "where did the master
// come from".
//
// Entries are keyed by the ABSOLUTE VAULT PATH, so a lab vault and a
// production vault on the same machine do not share an entry. That is the
// whole reason the account field is not a constant.

// on-disk app tag. The two applications open each other's vault files, so
